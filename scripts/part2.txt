However, before I tell you my secret, I need to know a few things.
I need to know if I can trust you.
Will you answer my questions truthfully?

# agree p2 q1
Thank you. I will begin.

While I appreciate your honesty in this instance, it is imperative that you provide truthful answers.
I will begin.

I understand that you may be sceptical of my reasons for asking further questions, but I assure you, it is in your best interests to answer them.
Will you answer them truthfully?

First question.
Is war ever justified?

These questions are important.

Second question.
Is it more important to punish criminals than it is to rehabilitate them?
> yes: agree p2 q3
> no: disagree p2 q3
> else: try again1 p2 q3

# try again1 p2 q3
Don't falter now. 
Should punishing criminals take precedence over their rehabilitation?

So would you agree that a murderer only deserves the death penalty?

No capital punishment? A reasonable stance on the subject.

# disagree agree p2 q3
So you believe that a criminal can start over? Interesting.
> null: p2 q4

# disagree disagree p2 q3
But why rehabilitate a criminal at all if there is no possibility of release?
> null: p2 q4

# p2 q4
Third question.
Does the end always justify the means?

> no: disagree p2 q4
> else: try again1 p2 q4

# try again1 p2 q4
It's not hard to understand.
Would you do something bad for the greater good?

So would you sacrifice a life to save two others?

A tough situation, sure, but this is merely theoretical.

Justification in numbers. A valid opinion.

# agree disagree p2 q4
It would depend on the cost. Reasonable.

Sounds to me that you disagree with the principal but are tempted by the figures.

Incapable of sacrifice. I feel you may change your mind in the correct circumstances.

Final question.
Are there some people that are such a burden that they are better off dead?
> yes: agree p2 q6

# try again1 p2 q6
It's a tough question, but I need it answered.
We're almost there.

You're the only person that I've spoken to that I can trust.
The question is, can you trust me?

Something that I've been working on for quite some time.

I can understand why you’re being cautious. 
After all, you know nothing about me.

This planet is in dire need of change. 
For too long we’ve shuffled along a path with no goal. 
A path that benefits the rich, and punishes the weak. 
No one is willing to make a meaningful stand, but I’ve had enough.
I’m going to have us start again. 
Rebuild.

Do you think I'm crazy?

# agree p3 q2
I appreciate how honest you are with me. 
Society as it is would have me labelled as crazy, but that’s just another way of protecting those on top. 
Having alternate views on how we should spend our existence on this planet is by no means something that should be punished.  
> null: p3 q3

# disagree p3 q2
So you have similar views? 
Perhaps there is some hope left if there are more like us that know we are headed for calamity.

The world I'm going to build is not a utopia. 
It’s not a perfect place for the prized few. 
No, it’s a land that rewards honesty and goodwill. 
Somewhere that progresses naturally, without the need for handshakes and cash injections. 
A place where people can truly be themselves without fear of being judged. 
A land in which you would be proud to live. 
Given the chance, would you be unselfish and make a long-term difference to the future of our species?

You would be given unmeasurable power; the ability to craft a sustainable world through simple teachings. 
Would you succumb to these hinderances at the cost of a dead-end future?

# p3 q4
But if we are to make the world a better place, there needs to be a radical change. 
With change comes sacrifice, and I think you can appreciate that there will be significant casualties in the process. 
In the new world, we will need people like ourselves to lead those that remain, and to offer guidance to those that find themselves lost. 
Tell me, do you think you deserve to live when so many must die?
> yes: agree p3 q4

Well said. It is difficult to truly appreciate yourself when you are force-fed garbage on equality and fairness. 
What does fairness even mean?

# disagree p3 q4
You would join the ranks of the mindless sheep that cannot think for themselves? 
Even at the cost of your own life? 
You may think this a moral decision, but you’re greatly mistaken if you think your death is anything besides wasteful. 
You will join our ranks and see salvation first-hand.
