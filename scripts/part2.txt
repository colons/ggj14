I trust you.
You're the only person that I've spoken to that I can trust.
The question is, can you trust me?

# try again1 p3 q1
Come on now, I just need a simple answer. Can you trust me?
> yes: agree p3 q1
> no: disagree p3 q1

# try again2 p3 q1
It's a question, and the first of many. 
Give me an answer or we are done. Can you trust me?

> no: disagree p3 q1
> else: try again3 p3 q1

# try again3 p3 q1
Fine. I won't waste my time further.

# agree p3 q1
This is good. 
I'm about to let you in on something I've been planning. 
Something that I've been working on for quite some time.

# disagree p3 q1
I can understand why youre being cautious. 
After all, you know nothing about me.

# p3 q2
This planet is in dire need of change. 
For too long weve shuffled along a path with no goal. 
A path that benefits the rich, and punishes the weak. 
No one is willing to make a meaningful stand, but Ive had enough.
Im going to have us start again. 
Rebuild.
...
Do you think I'm crazy?

# agree p3 q2
I appreciate how honest you are with me. 
Society as it is would have me labelled as crazy, but thats just another way of protecting those on top. 
Having alternate views on how we should spend our existence on this planet is by no means something that should be punished.  
> null: p3 q3

# disagree p3 q2
So you have similar views? 
Perhaps there is some hope left if there are more like us that know we are headed for calamity.

# try again1 p3 q2
No need to restrain yourself, I'd like an honest answer. Do you think I'm crazy?
> yes: agree p3 q2
> no: disagree p3 q2

# try again2 p3 q2
You are testing my patience. I won't ask you again. Do you think I'm crazy?

# try again3 p3 q2
I see this is trivial to you. Goodbye.

This new world is not a utopia. 
Its not a perfect place for the prized few. 
No, its a land that rewards honesty and goodwill. 
Somewhere that progresses naturally, without the need for handshakes and cash injections. 
A place where people can truly be themselves without fear of being judged. 
A land in which you would be proud to live in. 
Given the chance, would you be unselfish and make a long-term difference to the future of our species?

# agree p3 q3
We can be the solution to a problem that wont otherwise be fixed. 
A turning point in the history of mankind.  
> null: p3 q4

# disagree p3 q3
Are you shy, or merely a coward? 
You would be given unmeasurable power; the ability to craft a sustainable world through simple teachings. 
Would you succumb to these hinderances at the cost of a dead-end future? 
I think not. 
> null: p3 q4

# try again1 p3 q3
It's a simple question.
Will you make a long-term difference?
> yes: agree p3 q3
> no: disagree p3 q3
> else: try again2 p3 q3

# try again2 p3 q3
I am not willing to collaborate with someone who will so easily falter. 
Final chance.
Will you make a long-term difference?
> yes: agree p3 q3
> no: disagree p3 q3
> else: try again3 p3 q3

# try again3 p3 q3
Fine.

# p3 q4
But if we are to make the world a better place, there needs to be a radical change. 
With change comes sacrifice, and I think you can appreciate that there will be significant casualties in the process. 
In the new world, we will need people like ourselves to lead those that remain, and to offer guidance to those that find themselves lost. 
Tell me, do you think you deserve to live when so many must die?
> yes: agree p3 q4
> no: disagree p3 q4

# agree p3 q4
Well said. It is difficult to truly appreciate yourself when you are force-fed garbage on equality and fairness. 
What does fairness even mean? 
> null: p3 q5

# disagree p3 q4
You would join the ranks of the mindless sheep that cannot think for themselves? 
Even at the cost of your own life? 
You may think this a moral decision, but youre greatly mistaken if you think your death is anything besides wasteful. 
You will join our ranks and see salvation first-hand. 
> null: p3 q5

# try again1 p3 q4
Perhaps you didn't understand me.
Do you think you deserve to continue living?
> yes: agree p3 q4
> no: disagree p3 q4
> else: try again2 p3 q4

# try again2 p3 q4
Dodging the question will not work.
Give me your answer.
Should you live when everyone must die?

# try again3 p3 q4
It seems I will decide for you.
* leave

# p3 q5
I can't tell you what my plans are.
Rather, I won't.
But know that the world will not be able to react quick enough to stop it.
You are the first person I trust, and I will find few others.
And we will rebuild. 
You are part of this now. 
But I will ask you again.
Do you want to know my secret?
> yes: agree p3 q5

# agree p3 q5
Good.
I think you are ready to see it.

# finalfudge p3 q5
[user], we've come this far and you don't want to know?
I will only you ask you once more.
Do you want to know my secret?

# finalfudge2 p3 q5
Fine.
What a waste of my time.
