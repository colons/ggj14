/e It is pretty dumb.
/c I've also created a very elaborate ending
/o How elaborate?
/c Can't tell you. It's a secret. 
/n It'd probably be better if you just got on with it

/c True
/e You know what?
/e We should play some Nidhogg
/c Sure.
/o I thought you were going to work on this game of yours?

/e so if we're robots
/e why can't we just throw Ymir out of this channel?
/n you see the tilde on his name?
