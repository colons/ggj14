# A Conversation with Ymir

An [entry](http://globalgamejam.org/2014/games/conversation-ymir) in Global
Game Jam 2014, by Very Scary Scenario (Chris Walden, Alexander Rennerfelt,
Nicholas Edwards and Iain Dawson). There's a
[trailer](http://youtu.be/ED4oib6O02k), too, if you need to be convinced.

You can play at [ggj14.colons.co](http://ggj14.colons.co), but if you're
determined to run it locally, you should be able to just pull it and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py runserver
```
