# A Conversation with Ymir

An [entry][ggj] in Global Game Jam 2014, by Very Scary Scenario (Chris Walden,
Alexander Rennerfelt, Nicholas Edwards and Iain Dawson). There's a
[trailer][trailer], too, if you need to be convinced.

You can play at [ggj14.colons.co][play], but if you're determined to run it
locally, you should be able to just pull it and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py syncdb
python manage.py runserver
```
